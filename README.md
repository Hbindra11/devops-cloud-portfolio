# DevOps Labs 🧰

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in **DevOps and Cloud Engineering** — part of a personal 8-week practice plan focused on continuous integration, containerization, cloud infrastructure, and automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The labs and projects in this repo are designed to build practical experience across key DevOps domains:

- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Containers** – Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Orchestration** – Kubernetes (Minikube, KodeKloud)  
- **Cloud Platforms** – AWS Free Tier (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)  
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform  
- **DevSecOps Practices** – secrets management, RBAC, secure configurations  

Each lab folder includes setup instructions, scripts, and a short reflection on what I learned.

```

The repository is being gradually structured as I progress through my 8-week DevOps practice plan.  
Current focus: completing Linux fundamentals and preparing to start AWS labs (Week 1).  
CI/CD workflow created early as part of initial DevOps setup — to be expanded later with Docker and deployment automation.

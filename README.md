# DevOps & Cloud Learning Portfolio 🧰  

This repository documents my learning journey in **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**, combining study, guided practice, and continuous upskilling.  
It forms part of a personal **8-week structured learning plan** focused on continuous integration, containerization, cloud infrastructure, and automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The labs and projects in this repo are designed to build practical experience across key DevOps domains:

- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Containers** – Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Orchestration** – Kubernetes (Minikube, KodeKloud)  
- **Cloud Platforms** – AWS Free Tier (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)  
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform  
- **DevSecOps Practices** – secrets management, RBAC, secure configurations  

Each lab folder includes setup instructions, scripts, and a short reflection on what I learned.

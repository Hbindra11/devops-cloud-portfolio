# Week 02 ‚Äì AWS Hands-on Labs ‚òÅÔ∏è

This week focuses on applying AWS fundamentals through Skill Builder labs and continuing the Cloud Practitioner Essentials course.  
The goal is to reinforce theoretical concepts with hands-on experience using **EC2** and **S3**.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals
- Practice launching and managing EC2 instances.  
- Explore AWS storage services, especially S3.  
- Understand core storage concepts like durability, scalability, and cost efficiency.  
- Strengthen theoretical understanding through Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Module 6).

## üß† Reflection
This week built directly on the compute concepts from last week‚Äôs EC2 theory.  
Completing the EC2 and S3 labs helped connect theory to practice ‚Äî especially understanding **how resources are provisioned and secured** in AWS.  
Module 6 on storage gave valuable background before the S3 lab, making it easier to follow the concepts of *durability, redundancy,* and *scalability*.  
Next, I plan to continue with IAM and billing-related hands-on labs to complete the AWS fundamentals track.

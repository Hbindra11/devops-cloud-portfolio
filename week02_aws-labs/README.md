# Week 02 ‚Äì AWS & Linux Hands-on Labs ‚òÅÔ∏èüêß  

This week focused on **strengthening AWS foundational skills** through Skill Builder labs and continuing to build **Linux fundamentals** for DevOps using KodeKloud.  
The goal was to reinforce theory from the *AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials* course and apply it in hands-on environments, developing confidence in both **cloud management** and **system operations**.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals  
- Practice AWS compute, storage, networking, and security fundamentals (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudTrail).  
- Reinforce Cloud Practitioner Essentials theory with hands-on labs.  
- Strengthen Linux fundamentals relevant to DevOps (users, permissions, processes, system monitoring).  
- Develop a consistent workflow using both Linux and AWS environments.

## ü™Ñ Week 2 Reflection  

Week 2 was a significant step forward in connecting theoretical cloud knowledge with practical, hands-on experience.  
Through AWS Skill Builder labs and Cloud Practitioner Essentials modules, I strengthened my understanding of **compute, storage, networking, and security** fundamentals.  

Revisiting and retaking the **Networking** (Module 5) and **Security** (Module 9) assessments helped deepen my grasp of key AWS concepts ‚Äî from **VPC architecture** to **IAM best practices** ‚Äî resulting in improved scores (86% and 100%).  
Completing the **Introduction to IAM** lab reinforced principles of access control and user management, aligning perfectly with DevSecOps practices.

In parallel, I progressed further in the *KodeKloud Linux Basics for DevOps* course (now at **51% completion**), gaining comfort with shell operations, process control, and system monitoring.  
These Linux and AWS foundations are now coming together ‚Äî providing the necessary base for containerization, CI/CD, and infrastructure automation.

‚úÖ **Week 2 complete ‚Äì AWS & Linux fundamentals solidified.**  
Next ‚Üí **Week 3: Docker Deep Dive** ‚Äì containerize a Node.js app, use Docker Compose, and push an image to Docker Hub.

üóìÔ∏è *Progress as of 20 October 2025*

## üìò Module 1 ‚Äì Introduction to AWS Cloud

**Topics Covered:**
- What is cloud computing  
- AWS Global Infrastructure (Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations)  
- Shared Responsibility Model  
- Benefits of AWS: scalability, elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing  

**Reflection:**
Module 1 provided a clear overview of AWS architecture and core cloud concepts.  
The Shared Responsibility Model stood out ‚Äî AWS secures the infrastructure, while customers handle data, access, and configurations.  
Completed the end-of-module quiz successfully.

## üìó Module 2 ‚Äì Compute in the Cloud

**Topics Covered (Ch. 1‚Äì4 completed):**
- What is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
- EC2 instance types (general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, etc.)  
- Key provisioning concepts: AMIs, instance types, regions, and key pairs  
- Demo: launching an EC2 instance through the AWS Management Console  
- Understanding provisioning and resource flexibility  

**Next Chapters (Pending):**
- Pricing models and cost optimization (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot Instances)  
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling concepts  

**Reflection:**
Chapters 1‚Äì4 helped me understand how AWS provides compute resources through EC2 and the key decisions behind instance configuration.  
The console demo was especially helpful for visualizing the launch process.  
I paused before the pricing and scaling sections, which I plan to revisit after doing hands-on AWS labs to reinforce these concepts with practice.

## üß≠ Next Steps
- Begin **AWS Skill Builder hands-on labs**:
  - Launch and connect to an EC2 instance  
  - Create and manage an S3 bucket  
  - IAM: create users and assign policies  
- Continue Module 2 (pricing and scaling) after completing EC2 and S3 labs.

# Week 02 ‚Äì AWS & Linux Hands-on Labs ‚òÅÔ∏èüêß  

This week focused on strengthening AWS foundational skills through hands-on labs and continuing to build Linux fundamentals for DevOps using KodeKloud.  
The goal was to reinforce theory from the AWS Cloud Practitioner course and gain more confidence with Linux system operations and commands.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals  
- Practice AWS compute and storage fundamentals (EC2 and S3).  
- Strengthen Linux fundamentals relevant to DevOps (users, permissions, processes, system monitoring).  
- Reinforce theoretical concepts through practical, guided exercises.  
- Develop a consistent workflow using both Linux and AWS environments.

## üß† Reflection  

The first part of this week focused on AWS ‚Äî completing EC2 and S3 labs to strengthen understanding of compute and storage fundamentals.  
These labs helped connect Cloud Practitioner theory to real AWS workflows, especially around provisioning, permissions, and scalability.  

Midweek, I shifted focus back to **Linux**, progressing to **51% completion** in the KodeKloud *Linux Basics* course.  
The story-driven, hands-on approach (featuring Bob‚Äôs journey) made learning CLI operations, permissions, and process management engaging and practical.  

Next, I plan to complete the final **AWS IAM lab** and continue advancing in the Linux modules to reach 70% completion.
